# 🧠 Computer Vision Portfolio – David Romero Yánez

Welcome! This is my personal portfolio focused on computer vision projects. Here I showcase practical applications using Python, OpenCV, PyTorch and ROS, covering topics such as object detection, segmentation, OCR, and robot vision.

## 🎯 Objective

Demonstrate my capabilities in building and deploying computer vision systems from scratch, using real datasets, custom code and visual demonstrations. This portfolio is intended for future employers and master’s program applications.
